Logging Implementation in LAST
==========

For the last few days, I have been working on implementing logging in LAST. With logging, the goal is to accomplish 3 major tasks.

1) Be able to figure out how many changes have been made (a measure of how good our preliminary anonymization is)
2) Be able to recreate the original guesses form the log file
3) Make the log file understandable


These 3 goals ended up making the implementation slightly complicated. Specifically, the part that the log file cannot just be a dump of information complicates it.

My implementation revolved around logging the paragraph number and the position within the paragraph the change took place.

I have not quite finished the implementation yet: I need to eventually be able to deal with our unique icon code in the future. I plan to finish this early the next week.
