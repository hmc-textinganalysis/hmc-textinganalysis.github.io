Update 6/12
================
I started off the day by fixing some bugs that escaped me when I coded the part abotu unique icon. Speicifcally, if I split a icon with initial index i to new index j, and everted index j back, it created an additional icon with index i.

The majority of the rest of the day was spent on working on a fix for how to deal with huge import files. Through experimentation (and BadAlloc errors my Linux system was throwing), I was able to figure out a acceptable number of labels (1250) that Tkinter could load at once. Then, in the laod function in the conversation  navigator, I only loaded 1250 labels at a time. Then, I added buttons Previosu and Next that would load the previous or new rows. 

This implementation was a success, so I pushed it to github master, overwriting other previous attempts to load all the labels at once.

Our software, as long as I don't find any more stupid bugs, is ready to be packaged into a single file executeable. Yay! I will work on this tomorrow.
