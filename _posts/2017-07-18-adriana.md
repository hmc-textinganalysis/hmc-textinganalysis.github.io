================

<p class="meta">18 July 2019</p>

Since, as I mentioned in yesterday's post, I've pushed all major bug fixes to the script, I primarily spent today working on the poster since it is our highest priority to get that polished and ready for the symposium Monday. We made a couple passes back and forth with Professor Medero to refine our content and design into something simple and easily digestable for passerby. I think that it's just about ready, so we'll probably check it over together tomorrow and send it out to print.

Aside from that, I played around a bit more with the embroidery project. I finished digits and capital letters and sent all of my work off to Professor Medero to inspect and incorporate as she likes. I may continue looking for additional tasks I can try out within this project, because so far it has been a fun and rewarding break from development.

I want to check in about documentation for our project, since that seems like the next logical step in development. We'll probably update the README, but I want input from Professor Medero on how to format it to best reach both future developers and future users. That may require two separate documents, but we'll see. Overall, things are wrapping up, and I'm glad to know that I will be leaving with something tangible, functional, and intact as the result.
