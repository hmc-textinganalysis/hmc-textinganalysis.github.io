Update: Logging Implementation
==============================

Over the past few days, I was working on implementing a logging function.


The logging fuctionality keeps track of the changes made to the original texting file, and outputs it in a format that is readable ans parseable. This is important for two reasons:

1) The logging file can be used to reproduce changes to the original anonymized message. Since the logging fiel is invertible, you can revert to any point (which can be useful for trackign and undoing changes)

2) The logging file is a good measure of how well the NLP model performs. If the NLP model performs well, this means there is less of a reason to make changes. Therefore, the smaller the logging file, the better the NLP moel performs. THe problem with this evaluation is that if someone changes the label is, say, category 3 to category 1, then switches it back to 3 because he made a mistake, the logging file will record 2 changes when there should be none. Therefore, the logging functionality underestimates how well the NLP model performs.
