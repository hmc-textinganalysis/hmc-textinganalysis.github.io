Start on Feature Extraction
===========================

With the end of work on LAST itself, culiminating with a poster session at USC ICT, I began working on the feature extraction.

Today, I figured out how to run the code. There were several problems preventing me from doing so. The first were dependencies, which I moved into the github repo. 

The other problem is inconsistency betweem the output of LAST and the imput of the feature extraction. LAST outputs the name, number, date, body, and whether the post is an imessage or not. THe feature extraction only wants the name, date, and body. Furthermore, there are problems with the format of the date itself. LAST outputs date in thie format: "October 19, 2018 at 22:17:41 PM." Meanwhile, the featuree extraction uses the datetime module. I needed to do a little string parsing in order for the feature extraction to recognize the date.
