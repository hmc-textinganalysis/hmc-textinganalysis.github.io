================

<p class="meta">27 June 2019</p>

Thursday was spent preparing for both Friday's open house as well as the symposium. I spent the morning focusing on minor bug fixes in the code as well as the continued issue of packaging the program. I made some progress with that, but still have a weird error that I'm still trying to fix. Meanwhile after lunch, we finished revising our submission and submitted it to the symposium several days shy of the actual deadline. Once that was done I made a brief powerpoint to serve as a visual aid for our open house and helped prepare the space.

My workflow consisted of trying out different solutions (for bug fixes or our paper) on my own first before turning to consult either the internet or someone else (Professor Medero in the case of the bugs or Daniel for the paper) to ensure that I was on the right track. 

Looking forward, I know that Friday morning will be spent almost entirely getting ready for the open house - prepping the demo and the slides, cleaning up the space, and adding a few final decorative additions. In the afternoon, however, I imagine that I'll focus on fixing bugs or continuing to wrestle py2app.
