Fixing Unique Icons
===================

Today, I accomplished 3 main tasks:

Firstly, I fixed a bug in the number system of the icons in general. This was caused by a type in the counter dictionary,where I accesssed the 0th element,or the count of icons with an entity name, instead of the 1st, or the primary entity index.

The rest of my time was spent expanding the functionality of the unique icons. Previously, I implemented the icons being set to the primary index on default. However,I did not handle being able to switch from a unique index back to the primary index. To do this, I checked if the index of the icon corresponded to the primary index. If it didn't, that means the current icon has a unique index. Therefore, the index of the icon should be set back to the primary index.

The fixed a bug that you can continuously right click a label and make unique indices.


THe next step of the project is to combine Adriana's work for the day, which is to find a way to create a single-file executeable of the program. This will allow us to prepare for our meeting with the UCI researchers, and get feedback on what additional functionality to incorporate.
