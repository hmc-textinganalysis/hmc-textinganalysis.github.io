<p class="meta">14 June 2019</p>

Today was spent mostly slogging through various help forums for one specific error message that I encountered today with tracing the packaged application to the tcl and tk directories when it's being generated, such that the entire program may be exported and used on any (mac) system without additional downloads. I've tried out a couple of different solutions, but nothing has fixed the issue for me yet. 

I spent today primarily reading through people's suggestions and updating the program with suggested fixes from online. There are a couple different forum posts on stack overflow or github that offer some guidance, so I've been working through people's various troubleshooting tips to see if I can find a solution that works.

At this point I am grateful for the break brought on by the weekend. I hope that I can come at this issue with fresh eyes on Monday and see if I can find some way to settle this issue and have a working script to convert our final program into an application.
