Paper Draft
=============
Today, wrote a paper for a NLP symposium in Southern California. 

Luckily, I was given access to a previous paper about LAST that had a lot of literature review on it. This means I could copy a lot of the analysis of previous SMS work.

I spent a lot of the time working on the problem statement. I think the novelty of LAST relies on its ability to have 100% anonymity regardless of the accuracy of the NLP tools. The NLP tools just provide predictions.

This means LAST can actually be used to evaluate future NLP models trained on SMS as well.

We finished the draft and sent it to Prof Medero for feedback. Tomorrow, I think I will spend most my time editing the paper, so it will be ready to submit by the 1st.
