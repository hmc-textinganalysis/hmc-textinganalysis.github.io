<p class="meta">11 July 2019</p>

I spent a good portion of today working through the major bugs to see if I could find a potential solution for any. After some time and testing, I came up with a solution for the bug that occurs where identical tokens placed in different categories by spaCy were grouped together under a single label. Initially, I considered making unique labels for each categorization of the token. However, I ultimately settled on just forcing all terms to be placed under the first category in which they appear, with it up to the user to split and recategorize them as they progress. I do not feel that there are many cases where a word is deemed both a person-like entity *and* a nonhuman entity, so it makes sense to leave that as an edge case for our user to manage. This is the simpler solution to implement on the backend, and could potentially open up the possibility of fixing some of the other persisting bugs in our code. 

Since Daniel was out today, I pushed the updates I made to a branch and will have us review them tomorrow when he is (hopefully) in.

Looking ahead, there's still several large bugs as well as a couple smaller ones that still need to be fixed. I will likely continue to structure my days by starting off with those bugs, and then let myself switch over to the embroidery project when I need breaks in the afternoon.
