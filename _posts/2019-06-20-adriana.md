I spent today once again working through my trouble with pyinstaller. I managed to eliminate the error message I mentioned in yesterday's update, as well as a couple others that pop up while pyinstaller is compiling, by updating various modules and libraries. I've tweaked the spec file as well to reduce extraneous imports, so I suppose that all of that is a victory.

I am still very frustrated with the lack of progress in this specific problem despite my focusing on it for an entire week. At this point I've basically exhausted all potential documentation online that could help, so I'm turning to professor Medero to see if she can offer me any advice. It may help to discuss this with someone else who may have experience with this particular issue.

Depending on if professor Medero is free I may try to work through the issue with her. Otherwise, I think that I should switch to a different task just to give myself a break from this. Perhaps coming back to it with fresh eyes after some time away may help.
