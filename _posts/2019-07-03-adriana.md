<p class="meta">03 July 2019</p>

Today I worked on the bugs I identified yesterday afternoon. I managed to solve one completely, so that grouped labels can be split after additional tokens are clustered in with them. I also made some progress tracing through the second major bug I found, which is unfortunately more complex. I've already diagnosed how and where it occurs, but I am still working through potential fixes. 

My workflow today was fairly similar to yesterday's. It consisted of playing with the program to diagnose under exactly which conditions bugs occur, and how the user could fix/worsen them. That allowed me to pinpoint approximately which function calls are the cause of concern. I've added some print statements to confirm my suspicions, as well as keep track of the program's internal procedure. I feel fairly confident that I understand how it's occurred, I just need to figure out an appropriate fix.

Looking ahead, I need to figure out how to adjust the functionality of category adjustment to ensure that the two major components (conversation navigator and role selector) interface with each other smoothly, as right now they can fall out of sync. Professor Medero has also enlisted me to look into her embroidery project when I need a change of pace, so I will start playing around with that program when I come back.
