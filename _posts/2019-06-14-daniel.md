Final Touches to LAST
=====================

The goal of my work today was to touch up on LAST, in order to prepare meeting with the UCI researchers. I found a couple minor bugs in the code (none that impacted functionality). Since these are boring to talk about, I will take this time to talk about, in a short-term perspective, where I think I will take this project.


1) Aesthetics
Right now, the GUI is pretty rudimentary. I do not know how much we can change this because we are coding it via Tkinter. Tkinter offers very little functionality, unfortunately.

2) Scrolling Speed:
As of now, the scrolling works, but the speed is quite fast and uncontrollable.


3)Scalability:
The Gui actually scales pretty well before any of the icons or conversation navigator is loaded in. Once they are, it crashes when we try to scale it. I think this can be resolve by reloading the conversation navigator after the size changes.
