Small Big Fixes
===============

For most of my time today, I fixed small bugs.

Firstly, it seemed like special characters such as the emoji were not displaying correctly in the application. The first consideration was that this was an encoding error.

When I checked the xml file containing the text message itself, it said the encoding was UTF-16. This means Tkinter might be converting the UTF-16 encoding to- something different before displaying the text as a label. However, this was not the problem. 

THe actual problem was somethign  a lot more difficult to catch. When printing out to a label, Tkinter has a default font. However, it seems this default font is limited, and could not display foreign language characters or emojis. Therefore, the only fix I had to do was change the font to something that could display these encodings.

THe other fix I made was to the save file. Because of the numerous changes we made to the architecture of LAST, the save file was throwing an exception. I was able to edit the save_file function to write the anonymized document to csv correctly.
