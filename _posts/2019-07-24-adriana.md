<p class="meta">24 July 2019</p>

Since we're winding down, I spent this morning building a patch design meant to look like the Swarthmore College logo. Since Professor Medero is letting me make patches before I go, I thought it'd be nice to make both something for me as well as something I can share with other people in the department back home. I also figured out how to extract the dummy conversation Daniel and I made yesterday, so we now have identical data in the two file types we're trying to build LAST to handle. That required a few small tweaks to our code to account for the iphone formatting, and there's still some uncertainty as to whether I managed to mirror the researchers' format exactly, but it was a useful task.

Tomorrow, we will be having another poster session and panel with grad students from UCSD, so I imagine that the day will largely be focused on that. However, that will also be a good time to check in with Professor Medero about any last minute alterations she'd like us to add to the program before we go, as well as, of course, hopefully making some patches with the embroidery machine.
